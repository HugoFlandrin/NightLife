The goal was to create a project in five days based on a given theme : nightlife. Our team chose to develop a unique video game using Unreal Engine 5.

## Game Overview

NightLife is a 3D first-person video game centered around nightlife and the choices players make throughout their adventure. 

The game begins in a nightclub. From the start, players can explore the environment and make their first choices. They can talk to partygoers, grab a drink at the bar, or even pick a fight with the bouncer - if they dare!

Once outside the club, the player must find their way home, wandering through the city in the dead of night. However, unexpected events await them on their journey...

The game features immersive audio, with all voices in French, enhancing the comedic and absurd atmosphere.

NightLife is filled with Easter eggs and inside jokes, making it a fun and unpredictable experience. 

This game exists purely for entertainment; it is intentionally wacky and borderline ridiculous. It is not meant to provoke deep thought - only laughter!
